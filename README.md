# Fetching-with-Threads
This Python script is designed to generate JSON data concurrently using multiple threads. It fetches product information from a dummy API (https://dummyjson.com/products/) and writes the JSON data to a file.

# Features:
1. Utilizes threading to improve performance by fetching and writing JSON data concurrently.
2. Distributes the workload evenly among threads, ensuring efficient processing.
3. Appends fetched JSON data to a file.
4. Allows customization of the number of threads and the total number of loads (products) to generate.
5. Fetches product information from a dummy API for testing and demonstration purposes.
